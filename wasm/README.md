## Build WebAssembly

This started as rough notes for experimenting with WebAssembly.  my goal is to allow
the user of the any-base-counter to run the counter in Javascript or optionally in
WebAssembly.

I started from a couple blogs:
- From [medium blog](https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/hit-the-ground-running-with-webassembly-56cf9b2fa35d)
- From [flaviocopes webassembly blog](https://flaviocopes.com/webassembly/)

And later found a couple others (listed at the end).
(There are lots of pieces out there dating back to 2017.  Considering the $29 [book](https://www.levelupwasm.com/
))

The Medium blog outlines how to use a docker image, rather that installing emcc and the proper version
of python.  Gives examples of calling the main function.

The blog from Flavio has a better description of how to run Web Assembly from Javascript. (still don't know where he got the WASM=1 option).  Uses cwrap and ccall to call C functions within the WebAssembly
file.


### Docker Image to Run Emscripten compiler on .c file

The Medium blog post describes using a Docker image to run the wasm compiler instead of using 
the Enscriptem [install](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) procedure.  
I am using that to avoid issues with Python versions on my development system.

```
# Fetch image containing Emscripten
$ docker pull robertaboukhalil/emsdk:1.38.30
# Create a local folder for our WebAssembly adventures
$ mkdir ~/wasm
$ cd ~/wasm
# Launch a container called "wasm" (in the background)
$ docker run -dt --name wasm \
    --volume ~/wasm:/src \
    -p 12345:80 \
    robertaboukhalil/emsdk:1.38.30
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: The --volume settings essentially maps the /src directory INSIDE the Docker instance to a
"wasm" directory in your HOME directory.  

Then the instructions to do your first compile:

```
# Go inside the container we created above
$ docker exec -it wasm bash
# Now we're inside the container!

# going to skip Medium blog steps and use Flavio
# $ git clone https://github.com/pod32g/MD5.git
# cd MD5
#emcc -o md5.html md5.c
```

These were good instructions to see how to use the Docker image and how it maps to a local directory.  But I don't
want to use his "git clone" method.  My wasm files will be in a subdirectory of the any-base-counter project.


## My Steps

I tried to capture the set of steps I have used.

#### change to wasm directory
```
cd ~/Projects/gatsby/any-counter/wasm
```

#### creates docker container named anyWasm:
```
docker run -dt --name anyWasm \
    --volume ~/Projects/gatsby/any-counter/wasm:/src \
    -p 23456:80 \
    robertaboukhalil/emsdk:1.38.30
```

#### start anyWasm container
```
docker exec -it anyWasm bash
```

#### from within container
```
emcc any_base_counter.c -s WASM=1 -o any_base_counter.html -s "EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall', 'cwrap']"
```

#### this should output:
```
root@7ab7d94feb22:/src# emcc any_base_counter.c -s WASM=1 -o any_base_counter.html -s "EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall', 'cwrap']"
shared:INFO: (Emscripten: Running sanity checks)
cache:INFO: generating system library: libdlmalloc.bc... (this will be cached in "/root/.emscripten_cache/asmjs/libdlmalloc.bc" for subsequent builds)
cache:INFO:  - ok
cache:INFO: generating system library: libpthreads_stub.bc... (this will be cached in "/root/.emscripten_cache/asmjs/libpthreads_stub.bc" for subsequent builds)
cache:INFO:  - ok
cache:INFO: generating system library: libc.bc... (this will be cached in "/root/.emscripten_cache/asmjs/libc.bc" for subsequent builds)
cache:INFO:  - ok
cache:INFO: generating system library: libcompiler_rt.a... (this will be cached in "/root/.emscripten_cache/asmjs/libcompiler_rt.a" for subsequent builds)
cache:INFO:  - ok

cache:INFO:  - ok
cache:INFO: generating system asset: generated_struct_info.json... (this will be cached in "/root/.emscripten_cache/asmjs/generated_struct_info.json" for subsequent builds)
cache:INFO:  - ok
```

#### this should produce:
```
root@7ab7d94feb22:/src# ls -1
README.md
any_base_counter.c
any_base_counter.html
any_base_counter.js
any_base_counter.wasm
emcc_help.txt
```

#### from another terminal in ~/Projects/gatsby/any-counter/wasm:
```
open http://localhost:23456/any_base_counter.html 

To open the developer console window on Chrome, use the keyboard shortcut CmdShiftJ (on Windows) or CmdOptionJ (on Mac).
```


#### An example of exercising the engine code from console

```
// code snipets for emscripten console window
// Set mins
Module.ccall('wa_engine_min', null, ['number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number'], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
// Set maxs
Module.ccall('wa_engine_max', null, ['number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number'], [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9])
// Reset
Module.ccall('wa_engine_reset', null, null, null)
// Next
Module.ccall('wa_engine_next', null, null, null)
// Get
Module.ccall('wa_engine_get', null, null, null)
// Get
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
// Run 10 cycles
Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [10])

// Sequence
Module.ccall('wa_engine_min', null, ['number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number'], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_max', null, ['number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number','number'], [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_reset', null, null, null)
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [10])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [10])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [10])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
```

Then you can run the following to see the engine work:
```
Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [10])
Module.ccall('wa_engine_dump', null, null, null)
```

### Integrating with React/Gatsby
- copy any_base_counter.[js|wasm] to static
- import in Helmet (in seo.js)

```
...
    >
      <script src={withPrefix('any_base_counter.js')} />
    </Helmet> 
```

- and use the Module.ccall calling from the window object:
```
  const onNextClick = () => {
    if (webAssembly) {
      window.Module.ccall('wa_engine_run', null, ['number'], [1])
      setAllDigits(buildWebAssemblyDisplay())
    }
    ...
```

NOTE: We found the function signatures between the C/C++ code and Javascript
was the difficult.  For this implimentation, we limited the calls to pass
simple integers, rather than send an array of ints.  Similarly, we used multiple
function calls to get the digits of the engine, instead of passing back and
array.  I'm sure there is significant Javascript overhead to running WebAssembly.

In fact, we didn't see significant improvements in performance using WebAssembly.
We will need to investigate.


### Alternate WebAssembly Techniques

One thing I am finding with WebAssembly, is there are multiple ways to build
and integrate .wasm files.

This [link](https://brightinventions.pl/blog/using-wasm-with-react/) describes integrating 
wasm files with React, primarily for generating fractals.  The author uses an [online](https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/) tool to generate .wasm files.  The downside is they
manually access the mangled compiled name for a function.
